                               command lines are matched with respect to position.  If match is set to `exact', command lines must be an equal match.  Finally, if match is set to `none', the module will not
                               attempt to compare the source configuration with the running configuration on the remote device.
      parents                # The ordered set of parents that uniquely identify the section the commands should be checked against.  If the parents argument is omitted, the commands are checked against the set of top level or global
                               commands.
      password               # Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   The value of `password' is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of

                               path from the playbook or role root directory.  This argument is mutually exclusive with `lines'.
      ssh_keyfile            # Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   The value of `ssh_keyfile' is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified in
                               the task, the value of environment variable `ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE' will be used instead.

      update                 # The `update' argument controls how the configuration statements are processed on the remote device.  Valid choices for the `update' argument are `merge' and `check'.  When the argument is set to `merge', the
                               configuration changes are merged with the current device running configuration.  When the argument is set to `check' the configuration updates are determined but not actually
                               configured on the remote device.
      username               # Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.  The value of `username' is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of

                               will be removed and a new container will be created with the requested configuration and started. Image version will be taken into account when comparing configuration. To
                               ignore image version use the ignore_image option. Use recreate to always re-create a matching container, even if it is running. Use restart to force a matching container to be

                               see the [copy] or [template] module if you want that behavior.  If `link', the symbolic link will be created or changed. Use `hard' for hardlinks. If `absent', directories will
                               be recursively deleted, and files or symlinks will be unlinked. Note that [file] will not fail if the `path' does not exist as the state did not change. If `touch' (new in
                               1.4), an empty file will be created if the `path' does not exist, while an existing file or directory will receive updated file access and modification times (similar to the

      unsafe_writes          # Normally this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target files, sometimes systems are configured or just broken in ways that prevent this. One example are
                               docker mounted files, they cannot be updated atomically and can only be done in an unsafe manner. This boolean option allows ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating
                               files for those cases in which you do not have any other choice. Be aware that this is subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption.

  action: win_lineinfile
      backrefs               # Used with `state=present'. If set, line can contain backreferences (both positional and named) that will get populated if the `regexp' matches. This flag changes the operation of the module slightly;
                               `insertbefore' and `insertafter' will be ignored, and if the `regexp' doesn't match anywhere in the file, the file will be left unchanged. If the `regexp' does match, the last
                               matching line will be replaced by the expanded line parameter.
      backup                 # Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.

      encoding               # Specifies the encoding of the source text file to operate on (and thus what the output encoding will be). The default of `auto' will cause the module to auto-detect the encoding of the source file and ensure
                               that the modified file is written with the same encoding. An explicit encoding can be passed as a string that is a valid value to pass to the .NET framework
                               System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding() method - see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.encoding%28v=vs.110%29.aspx. This is mostly useful with `create=yes' if you
                               want to create a new file with a specific encoding. If `create=yes' is specified without a specific encoding, the default encoding (UTF-8, no BOM) will be used.
      insertafter            # Used with `state=present'. If specified, the line will be inserted after the last match of specified regular expression. A special value is available; `EOF' for inserting the line at the end of the file. If
                               specified regular expression has no matches, EOF will be used instead.  May not be used with `backrefs'.
      insertbefore           # Used with `state=present'. If specified, the line will be inserted before the last match of specified regular expression. A value is available; `BOF' for inserting the line at the beginning of the file. If
                               specified regular expression has no matches, the line will be inserted at the end of the file.  May not be used with `backrefs'.
      line                   # Required for `state=present'. The line to insert/replace into the file. If `backrefs' is set, may contain backreferences that will get expanded with the `regexp' capture groups if the regexp matches.
      newline                # Specifies the line separator style to use for the modified file. This defaults to the windows line separator ( ). Note that the indicated line separator will be used for file output regardless of the
                               original line separator that appears in the input file.
      regexp                 # The regular expression to look for in every line of the file. For `state=present', the pattern to replace if found; only the last line found will be replaced. For `state=absent', the pattern of the line to
                               remove.  Uses .NET compatible regular expressions; see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hs600312%28v=vs.110%29.aspx.

      http_caching           # Determines how upstream HTTP caches are instructed to handle any HTTP downloads that Yum does. `all' means that all HTTP downloads should be cached. `packages' means that only RPM package downloads should be
                               cached (but not repository metadata downloads). `none' means that no HTTP downloads should be cached.

                               repos. from "I'm about to install/upgrade, so this better be current" to "Anything that's available is good enough". `never' - Nothing is filtered, always obey
                               `metadata_expire'. `read-only:past' - Commands that only care about past information are filtered from metadata expiring. Eg. `yum history' info (if history needs to lookup
                               anything about a previous transaction, then by definition the remote package was available in the past). `read-only:present' - Commands that are balanced between past and
                               future. Eg. `yum list yum'. `read-only:future' - Commands that are likely to result in running other commands which will require the latest metadata. Eg. `yum check-update'.
                               Note that this option does not override "yum clean expire-cache".

      mode                   # mode the file or directory should be. For those used to `/usr/bin/chmod' remember that modes are actually octal numbers (like 0644). Leaving off the leading zero will likely have unexpected results. As of

      ssl_check_cert_permissions   # Whether yum should check the permissions on the paths for the certificates on the repository (both remote and local). If we can't read any of the files then yum will force `skip_if_unavailable' to be `yes'.
                               This is most useful for non-root processes which use yum on repos that have client cert files which are readable only by root.

                               docker mounted files, they cannot be updated atomically and can only be done in an unsafe manner. This boolean option allows ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating
                               files for those cases in which you do not have any other choice. Be aware that this is subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption.
