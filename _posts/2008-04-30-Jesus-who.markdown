Typical Chinese reaction to a bad habit of mine:

<something bad happens>
<em>Me:</em> Jesus!
<em>Li X:</em> What you say?
<em>Me:</em> Jesus. Do you know Jesus?
<em>Li:</em> Zhisus? I don't know.
<em>Me:</em> You don't know Jesus Christ?
<em>Li:</em> No.. Is it a bad word?
<em>Me:</em> .... Sometimes...
