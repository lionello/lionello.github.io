Typical Chinese reaction to a bad habit of mine:

&lt;something bad happens&gt;

<em>Me:</em> Jesus!

<em>Li X:</em> What you say?

<em>Me:</em> Jesus. Do you know Jesus?

<em>Li:</em> Zhisus? I don't know.

<em>Me:</em> You don't know Jesus Christ?

<em>Li:</em> No.. Is it a bad word?

<em>Me:</em> .... Sometimes...
