Quick <a href="/files/swapctrlcmd.reg">registry hack</a> that turns the Mac Command keys into Ctrl keys and turns the left most Ctrl key into the Windows key:
{% highlight sh %}
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,04,00,00,00,1D,00,5B,E0,1D,E0,5C,E0,5B,E0,1D,00,00,00,00,00
{% endhighlight %}
The format of the Scancode Map is as follows: 8 bytes header (all 0x00), 4 byte integer "count", followed by "count" times scancode pairs, with each pair consisting of 2 16-bit scancodes with "to" followed by the "from" scancode.

0x0000 will disable the key. The last pair is always 0x0000 0x0000.

You'll need to restart Windows in order for the map to apply.
