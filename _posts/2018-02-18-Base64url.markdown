This is a small shell script that I wrote to help with encoding/decoding Base64-URL encoded data.
It basically invokes the platform's `base64` and `sed` to turn regular Base64 into Base64-URL.

By the way, this is using the following markup to embed a Gist in Github Pages. You'll need to install the `jekyll-gist` gem to see this locally:
```
{% gist 6bb597fc600932c6c737aab3b402147c %}
```

{% gist 6bb597fc600932c6c737aab3b402147c %}
